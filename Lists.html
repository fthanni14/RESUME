		<h2>All about me. (Nikki)</h2>
		<ol>
        	<li>Hello, I'm Heart Nicole. I'm 14 years old and I live in San Mateo. 
            <li>I like reading, and I really like collecting them. I also like music. And rain, and coffee. The 				best combination for me is when it's raining, and I'm listening to mucic while reading a book, 					and drinking a coffee combination. It is RARE but when it happens, it's > (greater than) 						everthing else
            <li>Because my childhood didn't happen, I'm a child in a teenagers body. I do things I wasn't able 					to do when I was a child because I needed to focus on my studies. Until now, I need to focus on 				them, but now I can manage my time more efficiently. And since I was raised like a robot, I 					can't face intense emotions, I don't know how to handle them, so I run away from them. It's also 				hard for me to express such feelings.
            <li>One thing that people around me likes to tell me is "I can't understand you." And don't ask me 					why, I also personally don't know. But, I think it's because I push people away when I get too 					attached, but when they leave, I keep holding onto them. I know to myself that I'm hard to 						understand, even my own parents don't get me. I don't get myself either. So I'm trying my best 					to figure myself out right now. 
            <li>That's my thoughts these days. I really think I should fix myself. And reading has become some   				kind of escape or coping mechanism of mine that's why I forget about such problems like this. But 					I know that I will fix myself, I'm determined.
