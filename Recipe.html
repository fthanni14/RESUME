			<h1>Halo-Halo Recipe</h1>
			
			<h2>
				<i>Many people joke that the Philippines has two seasons: hot and hotter.
					<br>Cool off with some <strong>halo-halo</strong>. 
					<br>The word “haluhalo” or <strong>Halo-Halo</strong> can translate to something that’s been mixed together like this <strong>halo-halo</strong> dessert.
					<br><strong>Halo-halo</strong> is one of the most known foods or deserts in the Philippines. Many people eat <strong>halo-halo</strong>, especially in summer.
					<br><strong>Halo-halo</strong> is a Filipino-style shaved ice made with sweetened beans, fruits, and jellies and topped with milk, Leche flan, purple yam jam, and ice cream.
					<br>It’s a cold and refreshing treat you’ll want year-round!
				</i>
			</h2>
			
			<h3>
				<br>My recipe is simple, easy to do, and filled with ingredients that are easy to get. 
				<br>Some halo-halo recipes go way over the top. They include things in their <strong>halo-halo</strong> that we don't really need.
				<br>(Not judging them because it's their business.)
				<br>But we all want to have our <strong>halo-halo</strong> great and tasty, but good for the budget, right?
			</h3>
			
			<p><b>Halo-halo</b> can be made of different kinds of ingredients. But the main ingredients that will never be removed is:
				<br>Shaved ice, evaporated milk, sugar, gelatin cubes, and sago.
				<br>Most people prepare them with bananas, kamote, mangoes, langka, corn, ube, rice pop, and many more.
				<br>It can be prepared with any ingredients. Other versions of recipes are:
